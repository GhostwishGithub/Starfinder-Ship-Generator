Major Issues
====

- React refuses to stop screwing stuff up, misc. code everywhere, project is unservicable as a capstone, project needs to be restarted
- future project: python back end, java front end
-* python > django > javascript, possibly adapt existing front end, it still works!
-* document for starting over: https://devcodecamp.helpkit.so/tutorials/eH7WzkXpb926weLhL3QQZP/create-a-django-rest-framework-api-project/hjD2qPJE4ihqW2W96yT8Fw
-* old python backend seems functional if incomplete
-* JS frontend could be reworked?
 - Login page is dysfunctional
 
 Minor Issues
 ====
 - Armor not calculated correctly 
 -* (size)
 - Need multiple Security entries 
 -* (can have multiple systems)
 - Check weapons and expansion bays - are they actually working?
 - Weapon mounts for hulls
 
 NOTES:
 "ValueError: make_aware expects a naive datetime, got blah blah" is fixed by pipenv install tzdata, then go to settings.py and set USE_TZ = to false.
